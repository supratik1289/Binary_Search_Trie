Search Engine using Trie Data Structure

This was done as a part of assignment in the Information Retrieval (CS4201) Course at IISER-Kolkata. The code implements a search engine using the Trie data structure.

The importProcessAndPickle.py file takes an excel file containing data of approx. 33000 movies as input and creates a Trie data structure to store the index and then the Trie
and the raw data is stored as pickle files so that the searches can be performed using the second and the third file.

The file FieldSpecificSearch.py loads the pickle files created by the previous program and searches can be performed on the movie data.
